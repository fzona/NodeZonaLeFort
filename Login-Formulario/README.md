# ✨ Express.js Server with Socket.io, Mocks and Log-in

This project is a server made with Express.js and Socket.io.

You will see a form to add a product to the product's list, a chat where you can leave a message and it will be stored in a json file,
and a table that shows dynamically all the products. Additionally you can view a table with random products generated with [faker-js/faker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@faker-js/faker) on "http://localhost:8080/api/productos-test"
